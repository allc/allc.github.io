I'm doing MSc Artificial Intelligent, a Computer Science graduate. I write code (mostly in Python, currently learning Rust), do coding challenges. My area of interests includes natural language understanding and generation, computer vision and reinforcement learning.

Feel free to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:i@cjxol.com">i@cjxol.com</a>.

I'm looking for something to do or a Computer Science related postgrad opportunity.
