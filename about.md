I write stuff here as blog posts. I put random things that I come across in the continuously updated post [Things Blow Up My Mind]({% post_url 2022-05-13-things-blow-up-my-mind %}), and a collection of learning resources in [Awesome Collection]({% post_url 2022-06-17-awesome-collection %}).

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence graduate. I write code (mostly in Python, also use Java, and currently learning Rust), do coding challenges, play CTFs, and do hiking. I am also interested in topics about technology, cyber security, game design and mental health/neurodiversity.

Feel free to drop me an email at <i@cjxol.com>.

I'm looking for something to do either a Computer Science related job or postgrad.
