I write stuff here as blog posts. I put random things that I come across in the continuously updated post [Things Blow Up My Mind]({% post_url 2022-05-13-things-blow-up-my-mind %}), and a collection of learning resources in [Awesome Collection]({% post_url 2022-06-17-awesome-collection %}).

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence graduate. I write code, do coding challenges, play CTFs, and do hiking. I am also interested in topics about technology, cyber security, game design and mental health/neurodiversity.

Feel free to drop me an email at <i@cjxol.com>.

I'm looking for something to do either a Computer Science related job or postgrad.

### Programming

I write code in Python now, and I am learning Rust. I wrote code in Java before.

I used Django framework for web dev before.

I have also touched Node.js Express framework, Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, React, Haskell, Assembly (x86-64, I don't remember much about ARM assembly), embedded programming for AVR microcontroller using C to make operating system components and applications.

### Cyber Security and CTFs

CTF Web and Misc enjoyer. On my way to git gud in other categories too. Still learning to make good write-ups, read my write-ups in my [posts](/). Currently playing solo, with ad-hoc teams or [SIGINT](https://sigint.mx/).

- First 5 finished all 167 challenges in [AUS CSE 365](https://dojo.pwn.college/cse365/) Fall 2022 on pwn.college.
- Top 10 team in [HTB University CTF 2022](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/event/details/htb-university-ctf-2022-supernatural-hacks-696).

### Hiking

A lot of hills and not hills!

- National parks and not national parks including New Forest, South Downs, Dartmoor, Lake District, Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, Norfolk Coast AONB (England), Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia (Wales), Loch Lomond, Cairngorms (Scotland), Cinque Terre (Italy).
